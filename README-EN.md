ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Reservation API is a RESTful microservice designed to manage the full reservation lifecycle, 
including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of bookings. It uses INT as 
unique identifiers to ensure consistency across microservices and improve traceability. 
Built with scalability in mind, this service is optimized for deployment in cloud environments 
such as Azure and Render, as part of a modern microservices architecture.
